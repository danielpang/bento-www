# Pipelines

A pipeline is the assembly line a feature moves along: an ordered set of stages, each with an agent that works it and a rule for when a card may leave. Everything here is edited under **Pipeline** in the console.

## Stages

Each stage owns two decisions: which agent runs the step, and how a card leaves it. Edit a stage to set the name, the agent, how it advances, its requirements, and whether it opens a pull request, all saved together rather than one keystroke at a time.

| Mode | How a card leaves |
| --- | --- |
| Manual | A person approves or rejects it. Nothing else is consulted. |
| Automatic | Every requirement passes. With none listed, that means its agent finished successfully. |

New projects start with all six stages manual, so nothing runs away with your money before you have looked at it. Set a stage to automatic once you trust it to run unattended, and a card moves as soon as that stage's agent finishes.

A stage with an assigned agent starts it automatically when a card arrives, so a fully configured pipeline runs end to end on its own.

**Reordering.** Drag a stage card by its grip: the whole card travels with the cursor and the list rearranges underneath, so the gap it will land in is the gap it is already sitting in. The grip is focusable and the arrow keys move a stage too, because a pipeline that can only be arranged with a mouse cannot be arranged by everyone. Cards keep the stage they are in; what changes is what comes next for them.

**Where a card stops.** A card holds where you can see why: an agent that failed or was stopped, a requirement that did not pass, or a stage with no agent to run. A card past the last stage is done. Done cards take no stage actions and no agent will run on one, and a single Reopen action returns it to the stage it finished in so the work can be corrected.

## Gates

Each stage carries criteria, and all of them must pass:

| Criterion | Passes when |
| --- | --- |
| `manual` | A person approves the card |
| `run_succeeded` | The stage's agent finished without an error |
| `agent_judge` | A judge agent you pick inspects the work and rules it complete |
| `command` | A shell command you choose exits 0 inside the sandbox |
| `checks_pass` | Every GitHub check on the PR finished and none failed |
| `pr_comments_resolved` | No unresolved review threads remain on the PR |

Gates are re-evaluated when a run finishes, when a GitHub webhook arrives, when you press re-check, and every five minutes as a fallback.

**The judge** is a second agent, run on the same card once the work is done, told to end its reply with a verdict. Give it a skill saying what complete means for the stage, and put it on a different model from the agent doing the work: an agent grading its own output tends to agree with itself. An incomplete verdict holds the card and shows the judge's reason; new work gets a fresh judgment.

## Agents

An agent is a coding tool paired with a model, and a stage points at one. Add one under **Agents**, then assign it to a stage. Which tools exist and how each authenticates: [Coding agents](/docs/agents).

Change one in place rather than replacing it: a stage points at an agent by id, so editing carries every stage using it along, while deleting and re-adding leaves them all assigned to nothing. A pairing the tool cannot run is refused on the way in, and the check reads the merged result, so changing only the model is checked against the tool it is already paired with.

A tool this deployment cannot start is flagged while you are choosing it, with the command that installs it. The check asks the sandbox rather than the server, because that is where agents run: the Docker image, or the machine itself when agents run as plain processes. Hosted sandboxes install the whole set on first use, so nothing is ever missing there. When the question cannot be answered at all (no image built yet, no Docker daemon) nothing is said, because "unknown" shown as "missing" would send you installing something you already have.

Deleting an agent takes its recorded runs with it, transcripts and all, and the confirmation says so. The cards themselves keep their history.

**Skills** are the agent's operating instructions, sent with every prompt it runs. This is where you say what a stage's write-up must contain. The seeded agents ship with short ones; they are the first thing worth editing.

## The pipeline file

A pipeline is the part people tune for weeks. It reads and writes as one YAML file from the buttons under **Pipeline**, so it can live beside the code it describes and go through the same review as everything else in that repository.

The file carries the stages, their requirements, whether each opens a pull request, the agents by name with their models and skills, and each repository's setup and test commands:

```yaml
version: 1
pipeline:
  name: Default
  stages:
    - name: Code review
      slug: code-review
      description: Review the changes before they merge.
      gate: auto
      requirements:
        - type: checks_pass
      createPr: true
      agent: Code Reviewer
agents:
  - name: Code Reviewer
    tool: opencode
    model: openrouter/openai/gpt-5.6-sol
    skill: |
      Review the changes on this branch against what the earlier stages asked for.
repositories:
  - name: api
    setup: npm ci
    test: npm test
```

Agents are referenced by name, not by id: an id means nothing in the install a file lands in. Importing matches stages by slug and updates them in place, so importing over a live board leaves cards where they are, and matches agents by name, so importing twice edits rather than duplicating. A stage the file leaves out is removed only when nothing is sitting in it; otherwise the import refuses whole and names the stage, because half an import leaves a board in a shape nobody chose. Repository commands are applied where a checkout of that name exists here, and the ones that do not match are reported rather than dropped silently.

The terminal client has the same two operations: `bento pipeline export team-pipeline.yaml` and `bento pipeline import team-pipeline.yaml --project "New service"`.

## Repository commands

A sandbox carries git and the coding agents, and no language runtime. That is on purpose: which toolchain a repository needs is a fact about that repository, and an image that shipped Node would quietly pick the version for every Node project inside it while giving a Go project nothing it can use.

So each repository carries two commands, set under **Repositories**:

| Command | When it runs | What it is for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup | Once in a fresh sandbox, before any agent starts | Install the language, the tools, and the dependencies. `apt-get install -y golang`, or a Node version manager, then `npm ci`. |
| Test | The agent runs it, whenever it wants to | Prove the work. Your build, your unit tests, or both. |

The setup command is paid once per card rather than once per run, because a sandbox outlives the run that created it: the first stage installs, and every stage after it starts warm. Edit the command and the next run installs again. A setup command that exits non-zero fails the run before the agent starts, with its own output in the transcript, since an agent whose project cannot build spends the stage chasing errors that have nothing to do with the task.

The test command is handed to the agent rather than run for you. An agent that sees a failure while it is still working can fix it; a check that only runs afterwards arrives when nobody is left to act on it.

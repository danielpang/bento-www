# Pipelines

A pipeline is an ordered set of stages. Each stage has an agent and requirements for advancement. Configure under **Pipeline**.

## Stages

Per stage: name, agent, advance mode, requirements, pull request flag.

| Mode | Advance condition |
| --- | --- |
| Manual | A user approves or rejects |
| Automatic | All requirements pass. With none listed, advance when the agent finishes successfully |

New projects default to manual approval on all six stages.

A stage with an assigned agent starts when a card arrives. Sending a card back stops the agent and waits for user input.

**Reordering:** drag by the grip handle.

**Hold conditions:** agent failure or stop, failed requirement, or no assigned agent. After the last stage, the card is done (no further stage actions or agent runs). **Reopen** returns the card to the stage it finished in.

**Early completion:** drag to Done or use **Mark done** in the drawer. Intermediate stages are skipped. The card retains its current stage for **Reopen** (backlog if never started).

## Gates

### How do human gates work in a multi-agent pipeline?

In Bento, the agent pipeline at [usebento.ai](/), every stage begins with a gate, and new projects default to manual approval on all six stages. A person reviews the stage's output, then approves the card, sends it back, or steers the agent. Switch a stage to automatic once its requirements can decide: the card advances when every listed criterion passes, and holds when one fails.

All criteria on a stage must pass:

| Criterion | Pass condition |
| --- | --- |
| `manual` | User approval |
| `run_succeeded` | Agent finished without error |
| `agent_judge` | Designated judge agent returns complete |
| `command` | Shell command exits 0 in the sandbox |
| `checks_pass` | All GitHub checks on the PR passed |
| `pr_comments_resolved` | No unresolved PR review threads |

Re-evaluation triggers: run completion, GitHub webhook, manual re-check, or every five minutes.

**Judge agent:** second agent on the same card. Configure via skill and use a different model from the working agent. Incomplete verdict holds the card and displays the reason. New work triggers a new judgment.

Gates are part of every plan, including Free, which comes with 3 members and 5 agent hours a month. [Create an account](https://app.usebento.ai/) to set up a pipeline, or [compare plans on the pricing page](/pricing).

## Agents

An agent is a harness and model pair. Create under **Agents**, assign to stages. Tool and credential reference: [Coding agents](/docs/agents).

Edit in place. Stages reference agents by id; delete-and-recreate leaves stages unassigned. Unsupported tool/model pairs are rejected at save time.

Deleting an agent removes its runs and transcripts. Card history is retained.

**Skills:** standing instructions included in every prompt. Define expected outputs, artifacts, and code changes per stage.

Export/import YAML from **Agents** or **Settings, Config**. See [The agents file](#the-agents-file).

## The pipeline file

Export/import under **Pipeline**.

Contents: stages, requirements, PR flags, named agents (model, skill), repository setup and test commands.

```yaml
version: 1
pipeline:
  name: Default
  stages:
    - name: Code review
      slug: code-review
      description: Review the changes before they merge.
      gate: auto
      requirements:
        - type: checks_pass
      createPr: true
      agent: Code Reviewer
agents:
  - name: Code Reviewer
    tool: opencode
    model: openrouter/openai/gpt-5.6-sol
    skill: |
      Review the changes on this branch against what the earlier stages asked for.
repositories:
  - name: api
    setup: npm ci
    test: npm test
```

Import matches stages by slug and agents by name. Re-import updates in place and preserves card positions.

Stages omitted from the file are removed only when empty. Otherwise import fails and names the blocking stage. Repository commands apply to matching checkout names; unmatched names are reported.

CLI:

```bash
bento pipeline export team-pipeline.yaml
bento pipeline import team-pipeline.yaml --project "New service"
```

**Settings, Config** also exposes the agents file and pipeline file (select project for pipeline).

## The agents file

Agent list without stages. Export/import from **Agents** or **Settings, Config**:

```yaml
version: 1
agents:
  - name: Code Reviewer
    tool: opencode
    model: openrouter/openai/gpt-5.6-sol
    skill: |
      Review the changes on this branch against what the earlier stages asked for.
```

Import matches by name. Omitted agents are unchanged. File import does not confirm agent deletion side effects.

CLI:

```bash
bento agents export team-agents.yaml
bento agents import team-agents.yaml
```

## Repository commands

Sandboxes include git and agent CLIs only. No language runtime. Configure under **Repositories**:

| Command | Timing | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup | Once per sandbox, before first agent run | Install language, tools, dependencies |
| Test | Agent-invoked | Validate build and tests |

Setup runs once per card, not per run. Non-zero setup exit fails the run before the agent starts; output appears in the transcript.

The test command is passed to the agent for self-validation during the run.

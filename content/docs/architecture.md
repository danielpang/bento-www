# System architecture

How the pieces of Bento fit together. The diagrams are Mermaid, which GitHub renders inline. For the tables themselves, and how tenancy is carried through them, see [Database schema](/docs/database-schema).

## The system at a glance

Every client talks to the same Hono API. The server owns the orchestrator and the queue, Postgres is the only stateful dependency, and agents run inside sandboxes that the server (or a runner machine) manages through a common driver interface.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph clients [Clients]
        tui["TUI (Ink)<br/>bento"]
        web["Web console (React)"]
        mac["Mac app<br/>spawns the bento CLI"]
    end

    subgraph server [apps/server, one process]
        api["Hono API<br/>REST + SSE"]
        auth["better-auth<br/>sessions, device flow"]
        orch["Orchestrator<br/>run executor, gate evaluator"]
        queue["pg-boss queue"]
        bus["In-process event bus"]
    end

    subgraph data [Postgres]
        db[("Tables with RLS<br/>row-level security")]
        secrets[("Org secrets<br/>AES-256-GCM")]
    end

    subgraph sandboxes [Sandboxes, one per feature]
        docker["Docker container<br/>git worktrees"]
        sprite["Fly Sprite<br/>hosted"]
        localproc["Local process<br/>dev and CI only"]
    end

    agents["Agent CLIs<br/>Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode, pi"]
    github["GitHub App<br/>checks, PR threads, webhooks"]

    tui --> api
    web --> api
    mac --> tui
    api --> auth
    api --> orch
    orch --> queue
    queue --> db
    api --> db
    orch --> secrets
    orch --> docker
    orch --> sprite
    orch --> localproc
    docker --> agents
    sprite --> agents
    localproc --> agents
    orch <--> github
    orch --> bus
    bus --> api
```

The TUI can also embed the entire server block in its own process, which is what `bento` with no arguments does: it brings up Postgres in a managed container, runs migrations, and serves the API on a loopback port.

## The three modes

Where the board lives and where agents run are independent choices.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph local [local: bento]
        l1["TUI + embedded server<br/>+ managed Postgres"] --> l2["Agents in Docker<br/>on this machine"]
    end
    subgraph client [thin client: bento --server url]
        c1["TUI"] --> c2["Server runs agents<br/>in Fly Sprites"]
    end
    subgraph runner [runner: bento --server url --agents local]
        r1["TUI + local runner"] --> r2["Shared board on the server,<br/>agents and code stay here"]
    end
```

In runner mode the machine claims runs the server holds for it, so the board, run history, and transcripts are shared while checkouts and agent credentials never leave the machine. Runs queued for an offline runner wait for it.

## Life of a feature card

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as API
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant S as Sandbox
    participant G as GitHub

    U->>A: card enters a stage
    A->>O: queue a run (pg-boss)
    O->>O: resolveAgentEnv from org secrets
    O->>S: create or reuse sandbox,<br/>git worktrees per repository
    O->>S: start the stage's agent
    S-->>A: transcript events (bus, SSE)
    S->>S: agent commits, writes docs/bento/stage.md
    O->>G: open or update PR when configured
    G-->>O: webhooks: checks, review threads
    O->>O: read the stage's mode
    alt automatic, and every requirement passes
        O->>A: advance the card to the next stage
    else automatic, something failed
        O->>A: hold the card, recording which requirement
    else manual
        O->>A: hold the card until a person approves or rejects
    end
```

Stages hand context to each other through committed artifact files (`docs/bento/<stage>.md`), so a card designed by one agent can be implemented by a different one. Gates are re-evaluated when a run finishes, when a GitHub webhook arrives, on manual re-check, and every five minutes as a fallback.

## Tenant isolation, three layers

Multi mode keeps organizations apart with three mechanisms that fail differently, so no single mistake is enough to leak data.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    req["Request with session"] --> route["1. Route checks<br/>access helpers re-read membership,<br/>foreign ids answer 404"]
    route --> rls["2. Row-level security<br/>transaction runs as bento_user,<br/>policies compare bento.org_id"]
    rls --> trig["3. Insert triggers<br/>organization_id derived<br/>from the parent row"]
    trig --> rows[("Only this organization's rows")]
```

Background workers deliberately skip the role switch: one process executes runs and evaluates gates for every tenant. SSE streams are excluded from the tenant transaction so they do not hold a pooled connection for the length of an agent run; they check access at setup and then read from the event bus.

## Credentials

Agent API keys belong to the organization, never the server. They are saved through `bento setup`, the web console, or the API, encrypted at rest, and resolved per run. In multi mode a sandbox only ever sees the owning organization's keys. Local mode layers stored keys over the process environment, because there is one trusted user and no tenant boundary.

A subscription can stand in for a key. Locally, login sharing mounts each tool's own config read only and, for Claude Code on macOS, forwards a short lived token read from the Keychain per run. A server that runs where the login is not (a container, a hosted deployment) uses the long lived token from `claude setup-token` instead, stored as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` in the environment or as a secret; it satisfies the credential check exactly as a key does.

GitHub credentials follow the same boundary. Each organization installs the Bento GitHub App for selected repositories. The server resolves that installation per run and narrows its short-lived token to the repository being transferred. Docker worktrees are exported as credential-free Git bundles before a trusted temporary checkout pushes them. For Sprites, the server clones privately into a trusted temporary checkout, uploads a credential-free seed bundle, and later downloads the agent's committed bundle for publishing. Installation tokens never enter a sandbox, and sandbox-controlled remotes are never used for a push.
